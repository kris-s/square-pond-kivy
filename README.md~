#SquarePond

Version 0.9 for the 2014 Kivy App Contest

[Built with Kivy](http://kivy.org/)

####[Music and sound by Wes Shamloo](http://braincat.bandcamp.com/)


##Instructions
Currently, no stand-alone packages exist, SquarePond requires Kivy version 1.8.0

Download the source to the directory of your choice.

- Linux: Navigate to the directory containing main.py and execute:
```
python main.py
```
- OS X: Drag the main.py file into the installed Kivy App
- Windows: [Follow these instructions](http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html)

The game is best played with a mouse and with the game window maximized. Reading the source beforehand may remove some of the entertainment of "discovery" from the game. I hope you enjoy!

Many thanks to the Kivy team for making these tools, for hosting the contest, and thanks to: inclement, bionoid, quanon, kovak, brousch, and others for fielding my questions in the IRC channel.

###Known Issues
- SFX volume is 100% on Linux (should be 40% of music vol).
- Fleeing organisms can move erratically near window edges.
- Performance issues with high numbers of organisms (I'm a bad programmer).
- Score text does not move smoothly.
